# Equality

In Kotlin `==` checks for value equality whereas `===` checks for reference equality. 
This is much easier to understand for beginners than `==` checks value equality on primitives and reference equality on non-primitives.

Also this avoids problems occuring after refactoring. See more at [Avoided Defacts](../java-kotlin/02_Avoided_Defects).
